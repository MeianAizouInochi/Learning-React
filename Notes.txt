Step 1:
Refresh knowledge of JS.
    It can be executed in many environments - web browser, outside as server-side, Mobile via embedded Websites ---Versatile.
    2 ways to use js in project - within the script tags as inline js code ------------------ <script>code goes here</script>
    or we can create a seperate js file where we put our javascript code, then get it inside our html file using the following ---------------- <script src="file.js"></script>


    If we want our js code to execute after the rendering is done, lets assume because it needs to interact with a html element or such, then there are 2 ways to do this:
    1. we can put the "defer" keyword in the script tag beside the src, this will only execute the js code once the full html rendering is done.
    2. we can place the script tag inside the body tag at the end of the content inside it.

    React project requires a build process to run on the browser. 


    Adding the type="module" inside the script tag beside the src attribute, will make the js file act as a module, which means the js file which is the src here, will be able to
    import code from other js files.

    In js, the import statement requires the whole name of the file with extension, while react doesnt require us to mention the extension.


    for export there are 2 different ways to export data out of a js file.
     1 with default keyword and the other without.

     export default <Data>;

     or export let a = "b";

     when import for the above scenarios:

     import <somename> from "path";

     import {a} from "path";

     respectively.

     A file which contains default export, can contain more normal exports, but cannot have more default exports.

     When we import the data, we can assign aliases to the data we are importing using "as" keyword.
      we can import all the things from a file, by grouping them into a js object.
      Example: import * as <somename> from "path";
      Then we can access the data from the <somename> using the dot notation.
